# Concept Review

Assume you are in a pair programming session, and are the navigator.  For each of the lines of code below, provide the (nerdy) english instructions that you would give to your partner (the driver) that would make them type the code shown.

For example, if you wanted the driver to write this code:

```
let num = parseInt('2');
```

You would say:
> Declare a variable called number and assign it the return value from running the parseInt function with the argument '2'


## Javascript Fundamentals

```
let name = 'John';
```

```
console.log( typeof name );
```

```
let nums = new Array(10).fill('');
```

```
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```
let nums = [];
```

```
console.log( typeof nums );
```

```
console.log( Array.isArray(nums) );
```

```
for( let i = 1; i <= 100; i++ ) {
  nums.push(i);
}
```

```
console.log( nums.length );
```

```
console.log( nums[3] );
```

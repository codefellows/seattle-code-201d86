## Arrays

- Data Type - data structure **special type of object**
- A collection or a list of elements
  - Numbers
  - Strings
  - booleans
  - Arrays
  - Objects
- They can be mixed
- We don't have to predetermine the size of our array

- Every element in the array has an **index**(location reference)
  - JS Arrays are zero based index system

- Built in methods!
  - `.push()`
  - `.pop()`

- Property
  - `.length`

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  runs this code until the condition is false
}
```
